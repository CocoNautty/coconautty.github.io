                    As a dedicated student and passionate tech enthusiast, I am constantly exploring
                    new technologies and discovering innovative ways to apply them to real-world
                    challenges. I thrive on hands-on experiences, embracing the learning opportunities
                    that arise from tackling complex problems along the way.

                    While data and web design are key components of my skill set, my expertise extends beyond
                    these areas. I got my Bachelor's degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from
